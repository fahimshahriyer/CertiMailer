After months of development and dedication, the web version of **CertiMailer** was launched on **December 30**! What started as a simple script for developers has now evolved into a fully functional, user-friendly website that anyone can use. For those who still enjoy tinkering with code, the original script will remain availableâ€”because geeks are always welcome here. ðŸ˜Š

### What is CertiMailer?

CertiMailer is a free, open-source platform designed to simplify the process of issuing, managing, and verifying digital certificates and IDs. Itâ€™s a tool for event organizers, educators, and anyone who needs to issue certificates at scaleâ€”without the hassle of paid tools or clunky processes.

### Why CertiMailer?

Unlike many other tools, CertiMailer is completely free and will always remain free. However, to manage server costs and ensure smooth functioning, there are certain limits:

- **Number of Certificates/IDs Sent at Once**: A cap on batch emails ensures free-tier sustainability.
- **Number of Events Created**: Similarly, users can only create a limited number of events by default.

If you need these limits adjusted for your use case, just shoot me an email, and Iâ€™ll gladly increase them for you.

### Exciting Features of CertiMailer:

1. **Unique ID and Verification**:

   - Every certificate or ID issued comes with a unique identifier.
   - These can be verified on the CertiMailer website to display validity, recipient details, and the creatorâ€™s informationâ€”adding a layer of trust and professionalism.

2. **Organization Dashboard**:

   - All certificates and IDs are securely stored in the cloud.
   - If certificates are ever lost, they can be regenerated effortlessly.
   - Centralized management helps keep everything organized for your events.

3. **Open-Source and Free**:
   - CertiMailer is completely open-source. You can explore the code, contribute to its development, or customize it for your needs.

### How to Get Started:

Visit the official website at [certimailer.xyz](https://certimailer.xyz) and you will find a demo video to get started. The platform is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, but if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via email.

### A Note from Me:

Creating CertiMailer has been a passion project, and Iâ€™ve poured my heart into making it accessible to everyone. Since this is a free platform and Iâ€™m not benefiting financially, your support means the world to me. If you appreciate this initiative, consider supporting meâ€”it helps keep me motivated to bring even more features to CertiMailer.

### Final Thoughts:

CertiMailer is more than just a toolâ€”itâ€™s a community effort to bring transparency, convenience, and accessibility to digital certification. Letâ€™s make it easier for everyone to manage and verify achievements.
