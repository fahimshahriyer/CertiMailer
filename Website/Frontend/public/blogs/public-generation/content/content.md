Hi, I am Manas, and I will guide you on how to generate certificates in bulk without assigning any unique ID to them. This feature can be used by any user at any time without needing to submit approval. Since nothing is stored in the database, we can generate certificates in bulk without any unique ID and incurring costs. So that's it, let's dive into it.

## Steps to follow to generate certificates in bulk without any unique ID:

1. Go to this **[link](https://certimailer.xyz/generate)**.

2. Upload the CSV containing the columns, e.g., Name, College, etc. The first row is always treated as a header, so make sure to have the header in the first row of your generated CSV. Also, note that only CSV files are supported (rows < 400). If you have more than 400 rows, you can split the CSV into multiple files and upload them one by one.

3. Next, upload the template in any image format (PNG, JPG, JPEG), which will be used to generate the certificates (max size: 1 MB).

4. A preview will be available, and you can select the position of the text in the certificate according to the fields in the CSV.

5. Select all the field positions. You can also change the font, font size, font color, etc.

6. Lastly, click on the "Generate" button to generate the certificates. Once the certificates are generated, you can download them in a ZIP file.

7. That's it! You have successfully generated the certificates in bulk without any unique ID.

## A Note:

Creating CertiMailer has been a passion project, and I’ve poured my heart into making it accessible to everyone. Since this is a free platform and I’m not benefiting financially, your support means the world to me. If you appreciate this initiative, consider supporting me—it helps keep me motivated to bring even more features to CertiMailer.

Cheers,
