Hi, I am Manas, will guide you hwo to generate certificates in bulk without assigning any unique id to them. This feature can be used by nay user any time without need to submit an approval. Since nothing is stored in the database, we can generate certificates in bulk without any unique id and incuring cost. So that's it lets dive into it.

Steps to follow to generate certificates in bulk without any unique id:

1. Go to the this **[link](https://certimailer.xyz/generate)**

2. Upload the csv containing the columns eg. : Name, College, etc. the first row is always treated as header, so make sure to have the header in the first row in your generated csv. Also note that only csv files are supported (rows < 400). Please note that rows should be less than 400. if you have more than 400 rows, you can split the csv into multiple csv files and upload them one by one.

3. Next upload the template in any image format (png, jpg, jpeg) which will be used to generate the certificates (max size: 1 MB)

4. Preview will be avaliable and you can select the position of the text in the certificate according to the fields in the csv.

5. Select all the fields position. You can also change the font, font size, font color, etc.

6. At last click on the generate button to generate the certificates. Once the certificates are generated, you can download them in a zip file.

7. That's it. You have successfully generated the certificates in bulk without any unique id.
